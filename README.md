**NCIS-ENT and JNCIS-SP syllabus comparison spreadsheet and calendar checklist for studying.**

### // Idea //
After passing JNCIA-Junos certification exam, the valid path is to start studying for the Specialist level certifications. And you are like me and have not decided which routing and switching patch to choose for your carrier you are maybe wondering what to choose enterprise or service provider path? Or when you studying for the ENT you can add extra learning material to be relevant in the SP patch too, or vice versa. 

### // Comparison spreadsheet //
In the spreadsheet file are listed both certifications syllabus for easy comparison.
Marked in green has an identical match, also, marked in red are mismatched topics.

### // Tasks list //
To make it easier to follow the studying materials and to be on track with the syllabus I have created a Tasks list (jncis-ent-sp.ics) with subtasks and tags that can be imported into the todo calendar. In my case, I have created it in Nextcloud [Tasks app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tasks) and exported it to the [.ics](https://www.lifewire.com/ics-file-2622749) file. So you can track the progress and tick it off when you feel that you spend enough time to understand the topic.
